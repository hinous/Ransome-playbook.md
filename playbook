### 🛡️ Step 1: Preparation (Preparación)

The goal of this phase is to establish the technical and legal foundation required to respond to a ransomware incident without hesitating.

* **Data Resiliency (3-2-1 Backup Rule):**
    * Maintain **three** copies of all medical records.
    * Store them on **two** different media types (e.g., Cloud and Local Server).
    * Keep **one** copy "Offline" or "Air-gapped" to ensure the ransomware cannot reach the backups during an active infection.
* **Legal & Compliance Readiness:**
    * Pre-define a **Legal Counsel Task Force** to evaluate the legality of ransom payments under local and international laws (e.g., OFAC regulations or Mexico's LFPDPPP).
    * Establish direct contact channels with **INAI (Mexico)** and **HHS/OCR (USA)** for regulatory reporting.
    * Draft a **Communications Plan** for authorities and affected patients to meet the mandatory notification deadlines (usually 72 hours under GDPR/GRC standards).
* **Access Control & Hardening:**
    * Implement **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** on all administrative accounts.
    * Enforce the **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**.
* **Technical Inventory:**
    * Maintain an updated list of all **Critical Assets**, including life-support systems, imaging servers (PACS), and Electronic Health Records (EHR).

### 🔍 Step 2: Detection & Analysis (Detección y Análisis)

The focus of this phase is to confirm the ransomware infection, identify its point of entry, and assess the potential legal and clinical impact.

* **SIEM Alerting (Splunk/Chronicle):**
    * Monitor for **high CPU usage** and massive file renaming/deletion events on the EHR server.
    * Detect a surge in **"Access Denied"** logs, indicating unauthorized encryption attempts.
* **Indicator of Compromise (IoC) Identification:**
    * Search for known ransomware file extensions (e.g., `.wannacry`, `.locked`) and ransom notes.
* **Clinical Impact Assessment:**
    * Determine if the affected systems include **Medical Imaging (PACS)** or life-support monitoring databases.
    * Prioritize the analysis of servers containing **SPII (Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information)**.
* **Legal & Forensic Preservation:**
    * Begin a **Chain of Custody** log to document all findings.
    * Calculate the "Discovery Time" to ensure compliance with **INAI/HHS** notification windows.
